# `ends.at/your-github-username` redirects anywhere you like  

Your custom URL also points to shortlinks you create.  
`ends.at/your-github-username/link-name`

## 3 steps to get started  

### 1️. Connect with GitHub  
- If you don’t have a GitHub account, [create one here](https://github.com/signup).  
- When you have an account, [this link will automatically copy this repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=endsat&template_owner=endsat&name=endsat)  
- Leave the default settings. The repository has to be **public**. 

### 2. Add Your Redirect URL  
- Open the `endsat.txt` file in your new repository.  
- Replace `https://hi.ends.at/placeholder` with the URL you want to redirect to.  
- Click **Commit changes** to save.  

### 3. Test Your Redirect  
Go to: `https://ends.at/your-github-username` (may take a minute to update each time you save the file)

If everything is configured correctly, you will be redirected immediately.
