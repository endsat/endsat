# `ends.at/your-github-username` redirects anywhere you want  

Your custom URL can also point to shortlinks you create.  
`ends.at/your-github-username/link-name`

## 3 steps to get started  

### 1️. Connect with GitHub  
- If you don’t have a GitHub account, [create one here](https://github.com/signup).  
- When you have an account, click this link to automatically create the necessary repository and file:  
  -> [Create endsat Template Repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=endsat&template_owner=endsat&name=endsat)  
- Leave the default settings. The repository has to be **public**.

## How It Works  
1. **A GitHub repository** `endsat` is created.  
2. **A file** `endsat.txt` is placed inside that repository which has your destination URL.  
3. **That's it!** Visiting `ends.at/your-github-username` redirects to that link.  

### 2. Add Your Redirect URL  
- Open the `endsat.txt` file in your new repository.  
- Replace `https://example.com` with the URL you want to redirect to.  
- Click **Commit changes** to save.  

### 3. Test Your Redirect  
Go to: `https://ends.at/your-github-username` (may take a minute to update each time you save the file)

If everything is configured correctly, you will be redirected immediately.  

## Why Choose ends.at?  
**Setup in Minutes** – No backend, no coding—just GitHub.  
**Flexible** – Update your redirect anytime by editing `endsat.txt`.  
**Fast** – Cloudflare Workers do server side redirects behind the scenes. 
**Privacy** - Your links aren't tracked
**It's free**  

## FYI
URLs don't need to start with `http://`, `https://` or `www`.
