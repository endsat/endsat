If everything is set up right, you’ll be redirected instantly! 🎯  

## 🏆 Why Use ends.at?  
✅ **Zero setup** – Just GitHub and a text file.  
✅ **Full control** – Change your link anytime by editing `endsat.txt`.  
✅ **No limits** – Works with any valid URL.  
✅ **Blazing fast** – Uses GitHub’s raw file service.  

## ❓ Troubleshooting  
- **Getting a 404?** → Make sure your repo is public & `endsat.txt` exists.  
- **Not redirecting?** → Check your URL format (must start with `http://` or `https://`).  
- **Still seeing an old link?** → GitHub caches raw files. Try adding `?timestamp=12345` at the end of the URL.
